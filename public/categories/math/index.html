      <p>In mathematics, a <strong>group</strong> is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element, while satisfying four fundamental properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.
In abstract algebra, a <strong>group</strong> is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies four axioms:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Closure</strong>: For all ( a, b \in G ), the result of the operation ( a \cdot b ) is also in ( G ).</li>
<li><strong>Associativity</strong>: For all ( a, b, c \in G ), ( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) ).</li>
<li><strong>Identity element</strong>: There exists an element ( e \in G ) such that ( a \cdot e = e \cdot a = a ) for all ( a \in G ).</li>
<li><strong>Inverse element</strong>: For each ( a \in G ), there exists an element ( b \in G ) such that ( a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e ).</li>
</ol>
<p>Groups form the backbone of symmetry, structure, and transformation in mathematics.
Groups are fundamental in various fields of mathematics and science, including physics, chemistry, and computer science, where they help describe symmetries and conservation laws.
They are also crucial in cryptography, coding theory, and the study of molecular structures.
Groups can be finite or infinite, abelian (commutative) or non-abelian, and they can be studied through their subgroups, cosets, and quotient groups.
Understanding groups and their properties is essential for exploring more advanced mathematical concepts and applications.
A classic example of a group is the set of integers ( \mathbb{Z} ) under addition, where the identity element is 0, and the inverse of any integer ( n ) is its negative ( -n ).
Another example is the set of non-zero real numbers ( \mathbb{R}^* ) under multiplication, where the identity element is 1, and the inverse of any non-zero real number ( x ) is ( \frac{1}{x} ).
Groups can also be represented through matrices, permutations, and symmetries of geometric objects, providing a rich framework for understanding transformations and invariants in various contexts.
