In general relativity, spacetime has the same structure as a topological space.
A **topological space** is a set $X$ equipped with a collection of open subsets $T$ that satisfy the following properties for $O\in T$:
1. The union of any collection of sets in $T$ is also in $T$:
   $\text{If } O_\alpha \in T \text{ for all } \alpha \in A, \text{ then } \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} O_\alpha \in T$, then:$$\bigcup_{\alpha \in A} O_\alpha \in T$$
2. The intersection of any finite number of sets in $T$ is also in $T$:
   $\text{If }     O_1, O_2, \ldots, O_n \in T, \text{ then } U_1 \cap U_2 \cap \ldots \cap U_n \in T$, then:$$\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} O_i \in T$$
3. The empty set $\emptyset$ and the entire set $X$ are in $T$.
