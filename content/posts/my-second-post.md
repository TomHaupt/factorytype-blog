The blog is live, the pipeline is clean, and the domain is mine.

This post marks the moment I crossed the thresholdâ€”from tinkering to publishing. Every step is versioned, documented, and reproducible. No hidden barriers. No institutional lock-in.

Welcome to factorytype.
Here, I share workflows that empower digital autonomy and systems thinking. Expect deep dives into tools, techniques, and philosophies that help reclaim control over our digital lives.
